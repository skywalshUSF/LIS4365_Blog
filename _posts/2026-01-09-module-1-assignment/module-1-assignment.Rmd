Describe what was hard to learn in this module, are you familiar with programming languages?

In this module, I recognized that the syntax for JavaScript may be different from other programming languages that I have learned, which made it hard for me to understand how to write certain pieces of code in JavaScript. For instance, in most programming languages, typing the print() or println() function would allow the program to display output, but in JavaScript, console.log() is used for that purpose, and I also noticed that I do not have to specify a data type in JavaScript when calling or declaring variables. Instead, I can simply type "let" instead of just int or char to define a binding. There are many programming languages I am familiar with, such as Python, Java, and R. I still have experience with many basic programming concepts, such as data types, control structures like loops, conditional statements, and writing functions.

What is your experience with web development? etc.

My experience with web development began with creating my first domain name for a website and taking a World Wide Web page design and management course, where I explored basic HTML syntax, which allowed me to understand text documents that contain formatting instructions called tags, learn how to add information contained within an element's opening and closing tags, and determine which elements do not require a closing tag. Throughout this experience, I also became more familiar with FTP, file transfer protocol and expanded my knowledge on iframes and basic javascript for messages and a webform.
