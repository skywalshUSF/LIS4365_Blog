These are responses to our module 4 tasks:

For the Web Programming

1.  Create your own condition (you can use the if, or if-else condition) in JavaScript and run it on your website. Your script needs to be customized and not copy and paste from my power-point/page. Plus discuss in your blog what was easy and what was hard in creating the if conditions. Read again chapter 3 in our textbook: Eloquent JavaScript

This is the JavaScript code for my very own "if-else" condition that was customized:

``` r
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
// Set temperature variable
let temperature = 72;

// Print message according to conditional test
  if (temperature > 85) {
              var txt = "It's a hot one!";
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
  } else if (temperature > 60) {
              var txt = "The temperature is: " + temperature + "°F The weather is pleasant.";
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
    } else {
              var txt = "It's a bit chilly.";
              document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
    }
</script>
```

There were both easy and hard tasks for creating the if conditions. The easy part about creating if conditions is that the else and else if keywords allow me to have clear logic in my code, as well as being able to extend that logic. Additionally, I learned that I can use variables directly in the condition without any type checks.

The hard part about creating if conditions is that it can be tricky to figure out where to put curly braces. Just like the example code I had to fix in task 2, if curly braces are in the wrong spot or do not appear within an important scope, this can lead to an unexpected error. Similarly, if I omitted curly braces in an arrow function, that can also cause a syntax error because JavaScript interprets a beginning curly brace as the start of a function block. It is also hard to read, maintain, and debug if-else statements that have too many nested conditions. This is another reason I may have trouble placing curly braces in the right spot.

2.  Fix the code in this example and post the result in your blog

``` r
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo">Display the result here.</p>

<script>
var greeting;
var hour = new Date().getHours();

if (hour < 18) {
greeting = "Good day";
else
greeting = "Good evening";
}

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = greeting;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

The result is: Display the result here.

This means the error occurred in the script tag. The problem seems to be that the curly braces are missing from the "else" line.

This is the corrected code:

``` r
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>

        <p id="demo">Display the result here.</p>

        <script>
        var greeting;
        var hour = new Date().getHours();

        if (hour < 18) {
        greeting = "Good day";
        }else{
        greeting = "Good evening";
        }

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = greeting;
        </script>

        </body>
        </html>
```

The result is: Good day

3.  Download any image from the web and use Photoshop and save it for the Web.

Post the result on your blog and discuss your experience with Adobe Photoshop. Make sure to go over all the tutorials USF provided on the subject.

This is the resulting image after using Photoshop to save it for the Web:

My experience with Adobe Photoshop is fundamental. I took a class that involved creating digital art images on this platform before starting college, and I gained basic skills in digital image editing and photo manipulation. The main experiences for me at that time were learning about layers, masking, selection tools, and basic color correction to edit, retouch, and improve photos. I once created logos and surreal images with this application. Although the only best experiences I have right now for Photoshop are photo editing (cropping photos and using some other specific tools on them) and how to format and save images correctly, I am now familiar with saving an image for web use and making sure that the resolution is appropriate for posting it onto the Web.
