Then, post in your blog the difficulties you encounter. For example, problems with HTML editor, problems with hosting website, etc.\r\nHere is the link to my website’s homepage:\r\nhttps://skylarwalshlis4365.infinityfree.me/?i=1\r\nThe first thing I did was revisit some of the HTML code, CSS styling, and JavaScript techniques that I learned about in LIS 3361. I opened up my favorite text editor, Notepad++, after reading the assigned text, and looked over all of the code I wrote for the many files that made up my website. Some of the HTML and CSS was helpful to create the new website. After creating my webpages and style sheet, I used the FTP file manager provided by Infinity Free to upload my documents to the hosting service. I started with a home page and set it up similar to LIS 3361 with a navigation link column on the left frame and a content frame on the right. I set up the home page to display module 1 and then added links for module 2 and the new module 3 page. On the module 2 page, I added a link to the module 3 page and some simple JavaScript, and on the module 3 page, I added the required title, name, and simple JavaScript example.\r\nHere is the link to module 2 assignment:\r\nhttps://skylarwalshlis4365.infinityfree.me/Module2.html\r\nAnd the link to the new module 3 page:\r\nhttps://skylarwalshlis4365.infinityfree.me/Module3.html\r\nSome of the challenges I faced involved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For instance, in most programming languages, typing the print() or println() function would allow the program to display output, but in JavaScript, console.log() is used for that purpose, and I also noticed that I do not have to specify a data type in JavaScript when calling or declaring variables. Instead, I can simply type “let” instead of just int or char to define a binding. There are many programming languages I am familiar with, such as Python, Java, and R. I still have experience with many basic programming concepts, such as data types, control structures like loops, conditional statements, and writing functions.\r\nWhat is your experience with web development? etc.\r\nMy experience with web development began with creating my first domain name for a website and taking a World Wide Web page design and management course, where I explored basic HTML syntax, which allowed me to understand text documents that contain formatting instructions called tags, learn how to add information contained within an element’s opening and closing tags, and determine which elements do not require a closing tag. Throughout this experience, I also became more familiar with FTP, file transfer protocol and expanded my knowledge on iframes and basic javascript for messages and a webform.\r\nYour first entry to your blog is your link to your website address you will use in this class https://skylarwalshlis4365.infinityfree.me/ that displays the following image:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
